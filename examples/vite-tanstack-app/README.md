# Vite + Tanstack Router example

An example app that shows the use of `react-presentation-hook`
in a React app with Tanstack Router.

The app features a presentation, where the presenter sees
presentation notes on their screen, but the external screen
only shows content relevant to the audience.

The presentation can be controlled either through buttons
in the presenter's view or the external presentation screen.

## Running the app

In order to run the app, just run

```shell
nx serve vite-tanstack-app
```

within the repository's root directory.
